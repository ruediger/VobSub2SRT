VobSub2SRT is a simple command line program to convert =.idx= / =.sub= subtitles
into =.srt= text subtitles by using OCR.  It is based on code from the
[[http://www.mplayerhq.hu][MPlayer project]] - a really really great movie player.  Some minor parts are
 copied from [[http://ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg/avutil]] headers. [[http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/][Tesseract]] is used as OCR software.

vobsub2srt is released under the GPL3+ license. The MPlayer code included is
GPL2+ licensed.

The quality of the OCR depends on the text in the subtitles. Currently the code
does not use any preprocessing.  But I'm currently looking into adding filters
and scaling options to improve the OCR. You can correct mistakes in the =.srt=
files with a text editor or a special subtitle editor.

* Building
You need tesseract. You also need cmake and a gcc to build it.
With Ubuntu 12.10 you can install the dependencies with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev libtesseract-dev tesseract-ocr-eng build-essential cmake pkg-config
#+END_EXAMPLE

You should also install the tesseract data for the languages you want to use!
Note that the support for tesseract 2 is deprecated and will be removed in the
future!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
#+END_EXAMPLE

This should install the program vobsub2srt to =/usr/local/bin=.  You can
uninstall vobsub2srt with =sudo make uninstall=.
** Static binary
I recommend using the dynamic binary! However if you really need a static binary
you can add the flag =-DBUILD_STATIC=ON= to the =./configure= call.  But be
aware that building static binaries can be quite troublesome. You need the
static library files for tesseract, libtill, libavutils, and for their
dependencies as well.  On Ubuntu 12.04 the static libraries are only included in
the dev packages! You probably also need the Gold linker.

For Ubuntu 12.04 you need the following extra packages:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev libpng12-dev libwebp-dev libgif-dev zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev binutils-gold
#+END_EXAMPLE

If linking fails with undefined references then checking what other dependencies
your version of leptonica has is a good starting point. You can do this by
running =ldd /usr/lib/liblept.so= (or whatever the path to leptonica is on your
system). Add those dependencies to =CMakeModules/FindTesseract.cmake=.

** Ubuntu PPA and .deb packages
I have created a [[https://launchpad.net/~ruediger-c-plusplus/+archive/vobsub2srt][PPA (Personal Package Archive)]] to make installation on
Ubuntu easy.  Simply add the PPA to your apt-get sources and run an update and
you can install the =vobsub2srt= package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ruediger-c-plusplus/vobsub2srt
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install vobsub2srt
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** .deb (Debian/Ubuntu)
You can build a *.deb package (Debian/Ubuntu) with =make package=.  The package
is created in the =build= directory.

You can also create a source package and upload it to your own PPA by using the
=UploadPPA.cmake=. But this is only recommended for people experienced with
cmake and creating Debian packages.

** Homebrew
Vobsub2srt contains a formula for [[http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/][Homebrew]] (a package manager for OS X).  It can
be installed by using the following commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  brew install --with-all-languages tesseract
  brew install --HEAD https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/raw/master/packaging/vobsub2srt.rb
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Gentoo ebuild
An [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebuild][ebuild]] for Gentoo Linux is also available.  You can make it available to
emerge with the following steps

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/media-video/vobsub2srt/
  wget https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/raw/master/packaging/vobsub2srt-9999.ebuild
  sudo mv vobsub2srt-9999.ebuild /usr/local/portage/media-video/vobsub2srt/
  cd /usr/local/portage/media-video/vobsub2srt/
  sudo ebuild vobsub2srt-999.ebuild digest
#+END_EXAMPLE

You should be able to install vobsub2srt with =emerge vobsub2srt= now.  If you
want to use a newer version (3+) of tesseract you have to use layman.
See [[https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/issues/13][#13]] for details.

** Arch AUR
There also exist a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD][PKGBUILD]] file for Arch Linux in AUR:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vobsub2srt-git

** openSUSE
vobsub2srt has been packaged by the openSUSE community, and is available from the [[https://software.opensuse.org/package/vobsub2srt][Open Build Service]].
As it is not in the official repositories, you'll need to add =multimedia:libs= as an additional repository:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo zypper ar -f obs://multimedia:libs obs-multimedia-libs
  sudo zypper in vobsub2srt
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage
vobsub2srt converts subtitles in VobSub (=.idx= / =.sub=) format into subtitles
in =.srt= format.  VobSub subtitles consist of two or three files called
=Filename.idx=, =Filename.sub= and optional =Filename.ifo=. To convert subtitles
simply call

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  vobsub2srt Filename
#+END_EXAMPLE

with =Filename= being the file name of the subtitle files *WITHOUT* the
extension (=.idx= / =.sub=). vobsub2srt writes the subtitles to a file called
=Filename.srt=.

If a subtitle file contains more than one language you can use the =--lang=
parameter to set the correct language (Use =--langlist= to find out about the
languages in the file).  For some languages you might need to set the tesseract
language yourself (e.g., chi_tra/chi_sim for traditional or simplified chinese
characters).  You can use =--tesseract-lang= to do this.  In most cases this
should however be autodetected.

If you want to dump the subtitles as images (e.g. to check for correct ocr) you
can use the =--dump-images= flag.

Use =--help= or read the manpage to get more information about the options of
vobsub2srt.

* Bug reports
Please submit bug reports or feature requests to the
[[https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/issues][issue tracker on GitHub]].  If you do not have a GitHub account and feel
uncomfortable creating one then feel free to send an e-mail to
<ruediger@c-plusplus.de> instead.

If you have problems with a specific subtitle file then please check if
it works in mplayer first.  If it does not then please report the bug to
mplayer as well and link to the mplayer bug report.

For bug reports please run =vobsub2srt= with the =--verbose= option and copy
and paste the full output to the bug report.
